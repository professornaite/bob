## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
medicaldata::polyps %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = number12m, fill = treatment) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) + 
  # Make this ratio = (tallest column * binwidth * 1.5)
  coord_fixed(ratio = 6) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Participants binned by number of Polyps", subtitle = "Colored by Treatment") +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

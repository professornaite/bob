```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

# data 
nation <- c("Russia", "US", "China", "France", "UK", "Pakistan", "India", "Israel", "North Korea")
count <- c(4489, 3708, 410, 290, 225, 170, 164, 90, 30)
df <- data.frame(nation, count)
str(df)
df %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

```{r un}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
